## 🚀 Overview

**k8s-autoheal-operator** is a lightweight Kubernetes operator that watches for unhealthy pods and automatically heals them by performing a rolling restart on their parent Deployment. It detects pods in the following failure states:

- **CrashLoopBackOff** — Container is repeatedly crashing
- **OOMKilled** — Container was terminated due to out-of-memory
- **Error** — Container exited with an error

When a failing pod is detected, the operator traces it back to its parent Deployment (via ReplicaSet owner references) and triggers a rolling restart by annotating the Deployment's pod template — the same mechanism as `kubectl rollout restart`.

### Components

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Cluster Connect** | `internal/clusterConnect.go` | Establishes connection to the cluster (in-cluster or kubeconfig fallback) |
| **Pod Watcher** | `internal/watcher.go` | Uses SharedInformer to watch pod status changes and detect failures |
| **Healer** | `internal/healer.go` | Traces failed pods to Deployments, queues them, and performs rolling restarts |
| **Manager** | `cmd/main.go` | Kubebuilder-based manager with health checks, metrics, and leader election |

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Real-time pod monitoring** — Uses Kubernetes informers for efficient, event-driven pod watching
- 🔄 **Automatic healing** — Performs rolling restart on Deployments with failing pods
- 🛡️ **Duplicate prevention** — Tracks restarted deployments to avoid restart loops
- ⚡ **Rate-limited queue** — Prevents overwhelming the API server with restart requests
- 📊 **Secure metrics** — Exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics with optional TLS and RBAC
- 🏥 **Health probes** — Built-in health and readiness endpoints
- 👑 **Leader election** — Supports HA deployments with leader election
- 🐳 **Minimal footprint** — Distroless container image for security and small size

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker 17.03+
- kubectl v1.11.3+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster
- (Optional) [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for local development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally (outside the cluster)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zeldebro/k8s-autoheal-operator.git
cd k8s-autoheal-operator

# Ensure you have a valid kubeconfig
kubectl cluster-info

# Run the operator
make run
```

### Deploy to a Cluster

```bash
# Build and push the container image
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<your-registry>/k8s-autoheal-operator:latest

# Deploy to the cluster
make deploy IMG=<your-registry>/k8s-autoheal-operator:latest
```

### Verify it's Running

```bash
# Check the operator pod
kubectl get pods -n k8s-autoheal-operator-system

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n k8s-autoheal-operator-system -l control-plane=controller-manager -f
```

### Test the Auto-Healing

```bash
# Create a deployment that will crash
kubectl create deployment crasher --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c "exit 1"

# Watch the operator logs — it will detect the CrashLoopBackOff and restart the deployment
kubectl logs -n k8s-autoheal-operator-system -l control-plane=controller-manager -f
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The operator accepts the following command-line flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--metrics-bind-address` | `0` | Address for the metrics endpoint (`:8443` for HTTPS, `:8080` for HTTP, `0` to disable) |
| `--health-probe-bind-address` | `:8081` | Address for health/readiness probes |
| `--leader-elect` | `false` | Enable leader election for HA deployments |
| `--metrics-secure` | `true` | Serve metrics over HTTPS |
| `--enable-http2` | `false` | Enable HTTP/2 for metrics and webhook servers |
| `--metrics-cert-path` | `""` | Directory containing metrics server TLS certificate |
| `--webhook-cert-path` | `""` | Directory containing webhook TLS certificate |

## 🛠️ Development

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
make test

# End-to-end tests (requires Kind)
make test-e2e
```

### Lint

```bash
make lint
```

### Build Docker Image

```bash
make docker-build IMG=k8s-autoheal-operator:dev
```

### Multi-Architecture Build

```bash
make docker-buildx IMG=<your-registry>/k8s-autoheal-operator:latest
```

## 📦 Installation Methods

### Using kubectl

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeldebro/k8s-autoheal-operator/main/dist/install.yaml
```

### Build the Installer Yourself

```bash
make build-installer IMG=<your-registry>/k8s-autoheal-operator:latest
# Output: dist/install.yaml
kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml
```

## 🗑️ Uninstall

```bash
# Remove the operator
make undeploy

# Remove CRDs (if any were installed)
make uninstall
```
